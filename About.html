            <br>
            <span class="text2">This webpage is a little about me and my experiments with photography. </span>

            <span class="text3">My Story</span>
            <br>
            <span class="text2">Ever since I started traveling around the world, 
        I started exploring offbeat locations in search of tranquility. And in one such place arose my passion for photography. 
        I fell in love with photography a long time ago. I was 13 when I first started taking photos. I captured everything. 
        I was known as the friend who always carried a camera around.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="text2">But why? Why did I fall in love with photography?
            <br>
            <br>
        I loved photography because it helped me show people the best things about themselves. 
        I wanted to show the world in a different way that makes people think deeper. You see, photography is so much more than focusing and pressing a button. 
        People who click photos capture the world in their own way. If 10 people take a photo of the same subject, I guarantee that the photo will look different from each person.</span>

        And thats how my journey with photography began. Head to the <a href="Page2.html">Portfolio</a> page to check some of my work. </span>
